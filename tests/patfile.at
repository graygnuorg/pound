AT_SETUP([Pattern from file (keeping type)])
AT_KEYWORDS([cond fromfile patfile])

# A bug in pound versions up to commit d1b1248206 (inclusive) caused
# a change in type of patterns read from a file.
# When using -file with one of the following pattern types: -exact, -beg,
# -end, -contain, only first pattern from the file was compiled using the
# requested pattern type.  Remaining patterns were treated as POSIX regular
# expressions.
#
# This regression test verifies that it is no longer the case.
