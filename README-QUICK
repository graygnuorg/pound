Prerequisites (Debian)

    sudo apt install build-essential
    sudo apt install libssl-dev
    sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
    sudo apt install autoconf

Build

	1) ./bootstrap
	2) ./configure
	3) Standard make targets

		all - Compile the entire program. (default target)
		install - Compile the program and copy the executables, libraries, and so on to the file names where they should reside for actual use.
		uninstall - Delete all the installed files—the copies that the ‘install’ and ‘install-*’ targets create. 
		clean - Delete all files in the current directory that are normally created by building the program.
		distclean - Delete all files in the current directory (or created by this makefile) that are created by configuring or building the program.
		dist - Create a distribution tar file for this program.
		check - Perform self-tests (if any). 
		installcheck - Perform installation tests (if any).
		installdirs - It’s useful to add a target named ‘installdirs’ to create the directories where files are installed, and their parent directories.
